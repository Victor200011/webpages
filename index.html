		<!-- Number 1 - CSS and Styling - bold, underlined, italic -->
		<p>Hi! My name is <strong>Victor Yeh</strong> and I am a freshman at NC State.
		I am studying <u>Paper Science and Engineering</u> as well as Chemical.
		I am studying <ins>Paper Science and Engineering</ins> because I like the work environment and job opportunities directly out of college.
		I would like to pursue the duel degree program because having the <em>Chemical Engineering</em> degree open up many more doors for job opportunities following graduation.

		<!-- Number 3 - Paragraph 2 -->
		<p style="font-family:Times;font-size:16px" align=left color=#800080>My dream job after graduation would be to work for a chemical supply company or inside of a paper mill.
		I like to work on my feet and I do not want to work inside an office or cubicle.
		I would like to work for a paper company because paper is a sustainable natural resource that is part of an expanding market.
